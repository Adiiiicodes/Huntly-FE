## üíª Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

As this is a demonstration/MVP version:

1. **Mock Data**: The application currently uses mock data instead of a real database. The search results and analytics are based on predefined sample data.

2. **API Limitations**: The backend functionality simulates real API responses but has limited capabilities compared to a production system.

3. **Authentication**: User authentication is not fully implemented in this version.

## üåü Advantages

1. **User Experience**: Modern, responsive UI with smooth animations and intuitive search
2. **Visualization**: Rich data visualization for talent analysis
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Separation of concerns with Next.js App Router and API routes
4. **Performance**: Optimized for fast page loads and interactions
5. **Developer Experience**: Type-safe code and modern tooling

## üîÑ Future Improvements

1. Replace mock data with real database integration
2. Implement comprehensive authentication and authorization
3. Add more advanced search filters and sorting options
4. Expand analytics capabilities
5. Develop candidate matching algorithms
6. Add notification system for new candidate matches
